# 100_Days_Of_SwiftUI

### :books: Content
This repository contains my solutions to the course [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) by [Paul Hudson](https://github.com/twostraws).

### :man_technologist: Objective
Oviously, my primary goal is to learn the basics of **Swift** and **SwiftUI** and some other Apple frameworks.
Alongside this course, I want to get familiar with Git and Github, which is why I created this repository. 
Furthermore, I want to learn how to use the command line to become more efficient.

### :fountain_pen: What I've learned so far
- Swift language features
- SwiftUI Basics
- working with Git and Github
