# 100_Days_Of_SwiftUI

This repository contains my solutions to the course [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) by Paul Hudson.

Alongside this course, I want to get familiar with Git and Github, which is why I created this repository. 
Feel free to make any pull requests, so I can lern the process of managing pull requests.
